## 2025-02-19 - Mismatch in Module Location for `to_celsius` **Mismatch:** `to_celsius` (and `to_kelvin`) are located in `Math` module in `package/main`, but were found in `unit` module in `package/umt_python`. **Resolution:** Implemented `to_celsius` in `math` module in `package/umt_python` to ensure parity with `package/main`. The existing implementation in `unit` was left touched to avoid breaking changes, but the canonical location should be `math` as per SoT.
